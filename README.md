# User Greeting Page

This repository contains a simple HTML page that greets users without using the word "hello".

## Files

- `index.html`: The main HTML file containing the user greeting
- `test_greeting.js`: A Node.js test script to verify the HTML greeting functionality

## How to Use

1. Open `index.html` in any web browser to see the greeting

## Testing

To run the tests:

1. Make sure you have Node.js installed
2. Run the test script:
   ```
   node test_greeting.js
   ```

The tests verify that:
- The HTML file exists
- The HTML contains a greeting
- The HTML does not contain the word "hello"
